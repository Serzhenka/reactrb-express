# inline-reactive-ruby
react.rb for static sites, with no build process needed

## How To

1. Include inline-reactive-ruby.js in with your js files, or link to it from here: https://rawgit.com/reactive-ruby/inline-reactive-ruby/master/inline-reactive-ruby.js
2. Link to a version of jQuery
3. Specify your ruby code inside of `<script type="text/ruby">...</script>` tags    
   or link to your ruby code using the src attribute `<script type="text/ruby" src=.../>`

## What is included

+ Opal (Ruby to Javascript Transpiler) - currently version 0.8
+ React.rb (Ruby React.js wrapper)
+ Opal-Jquery (Ruby Jquery wrapper, including HTTP, timers, and of course DOM queries)

## How it works

Your ruby code will be compiled by the browser into javascript, and executed.  Any compilation or runtime errors
will be briefly reported to the console.

Ruby classes can mixin React::Component to become React components, and can use the React.rb
DSL to dynamically generate reactive DOM nodes.

## Example

See this example in action here: http://reactive-ruby.github.io/inline-reactive-ruby/

index.html:
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--[if IE]><![endif]-->
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1">
    <title>Inline Reactive Ruby Demo</title>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script>
    <script src="inline-reactive-ruby.js" />

    <!-- scripts can be remote or inline -->
    <script type="text/ruby" src="clock.rb"></script>

    <script type="text/ruby">
      Element["body"].render { Clock() }
    </script>

  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="clock"></div>
    <div>The time brought to you by <a href="https://github.com/reactive-ruby/inline-reactive-ruby">inline-reactive-ruby</a></div>
  </body>
</html>
```
```ruby
# clock.rb
class Clock < React::Component::Base

  before_mount do
    state.time! Time.now
    every(1) { state.time! Time.now }
  end

  def render
    "The time is #{state.time}"
  end

end
```

# Trying it out using github

Github makes a great sandbox to try every thing out online with nothing but your browser.

Have a look at the instructions here: https://pages.github.com/

but rather than "cloning" the repo, and editing your files on your computer
you can just create and edit files right on the github site.  

# Mounting Components

In addition to the standard ways to mount top level components inline-reactive-ruby will directly mount components that have the `data-reactrb-mount` attribute.  The attribute value should be the fully qualified name of the component.  For example "Clock".  Any additional data attributes will be passed as params to the component.  The attribute names will be snake cased (i.e. `data-foo-bar` becomes the `foo_bar` key)

# Building and Contributing

To build, clone the repo, run `bundle install` and then `bundle exec rake`

This will combine all the pieces and build the `inline-reactive-ruby.js` file.

To be sure we have no ruby dependencies we use this server for smoke testing:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 4000`

Contributions are welcome - things we need:

+ Examples
+ Some test cases
+ Minimization
